# CryptoClustering

This project analyzes cryptocurrency market data to identify clusters of cryptocurrencies based on their price change percentages over various time periods. The clustering process utilizes K-Means and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to explore the relationships between cryptocurrencies and reduce dimensionality for optimization and visualization.

# Project Overview

This project uses clustering techniques to group cryptocurrencies based on their market behavior. Key methods include:

K-Means Clustering: To identify distinct clusters of cryptocurrencies. Principal Component Analysis (PCA): To optimize clustering by reducing the number of features while preserving most of the variance. Elbow Curve Analysis: To determine the optimal number of clusters for K-Means. The analysis uses Python with libraries such as scikit-learn, hvPlot, and pandas.

Technologies Used
* Python 3.10+

* pandas
* hvPlot
* scikit-learn
* StandardScaler and PCA for data preprocessing
* KMeans for clustering
